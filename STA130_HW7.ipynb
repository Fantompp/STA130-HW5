If this model were to explain 100% of the variability, it would mean we could predict the HP of a pokemon just from its generation and spdef, which is clearly not true. For example, Pikachu and Machoke are both gen 1 pokemon with a special defense of 60, but Pikachu has a lowly 45 HP, while Machoke has a whopping 80."

My pokemon intuition says that all of these should have some effect on the HP, but they mostly serve to explain the same thing (legendary mons have high stats all around, and pokemon with high stats tend to have other high stats, up to a certain point). It also adds type, for fun. (I notice it treats first and second type differently, which is interesting).\n",
